## About me

I'm a creative and ambitious IT enthusiast with a background in music and education. Having completed a five-month internship in functional testing, I'm currently looking for an opportunity to develop and expand my knowledge as a professional tester. The intensive training has taught me about testing strategies, tools and attitudes that will help me find defects effectively, gather information about the software product under test and collaborate within an agile team. Currently, I would like to acquire a solid foundation of manual and automated testing skills to become an adaptable, flexible professional who embraces teamwork, adds significant value to the development team, and contributes to the creation of high-quality software products. I'm hoping to find a company that strives for perfection in software quality, values friendly relationships and creates a friendly environment for the growth of its employees.
